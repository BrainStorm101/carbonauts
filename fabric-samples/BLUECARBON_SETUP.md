## 📱 Ready for React Native Development

The blockchain foundation is **100% complete** and ready for mobile app development. Here's what you can build on top of it:

### Mobile App Features to Implement
1. **Farmer App** (React Native)
   - Offline-first data capture
   - Camera integration with GPS
   - Submission tracking
   - Push notifications

2. **NGO App** (React Native)
   - Project management
   - Bulk upload capabilities
   - Submission review interface

3. **Web Portal** (React/Next.js)
   - NCCR dashboard
   - Industry marketplace
   - Analytics and reporting

## 🔧 API Endpoints Available

The blockchain provides these functions that your React Native app can call:

### User Management
- `RegisterUser(userId, name, role, organization, contactInfo)`
- `GetUser(userId)`

### Project Management
- `CreateProject(projectId, name, location, coordinates, projectType, targetTrees, ngoId)`
- `GetProject(projectId)`
- `VerifyProject(projectId, verifierId, comments)`

### Field Data Submission
- `CreateSubmission(submissionId, farmerId, projectId, plantType, numberOfSamples, imageHashes, gpsCoordinates, deviceSignature)`
- `ReviewSubmission(submissionId, reviewerId, action, comments)`

### Carbon Credits
- `MintCarbonCredits(submissionId, nccr_id)`
- `ListCreditsForSale(creditBatchId, pricePerCredit, sellerId)`
- `PurchaseCredits(creditBatchId, buyerId, paymentAmount)`

### Queries
- `QueryPendingSubmissions()`
- `QueryAvailableCredits()`
- `QuerySubmissionsByFarmer(farmerId)`
- `GetProjectStats(projectId)`
